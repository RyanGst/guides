title: 3 mistakes that are killing your dev resume

A dev resume isn't just a list - it's a **context + impact sales doc**.

After reviewing more than 25 developer resumes (mobile, backend, fullstack, career changers, etc.), the **same 3 mistakes** kept showing up.

## 1. Talking tasks, not impact

The most common error: the whole resume is written like this:

- "Development and maintenance of applications..."
- "Worked on bug fixes and new features..."
- "Responsible for system X..."

That says **nothing** about:

- the size of the problem,
- how hard what you did was,
- the impact on the product or business.

Recruiters read this all day. It turns into noise.

> Fix: turn each bullet into technical action + what + how + metric/scale

## 2. Layout that kills ATS and readability

Another classic: a beautiful resume full of columns, icons, colors, emojis, and _creative UX_...  
and completely indigestible for someone who needs to read fast (or for an ATS).

Lots of people fell into these:

- **Multi-column** layout, heavy sidebar, icon, emoji in dates, cluttered header
- **Inconsistent** dates and sections ("Aug 24", "08/2024", "2024 - present")
- Important sections missing or weak: **Projects**, poorly separated **Skills**, giant text blocks

> Fix: **One column only**

## 3. Stack misaligned with experience (or too shallow)

Saw this a lot:

- giant skills list (Java 8 years, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Flutter, React...) **without showing it once** in roles
- technologies only in the "Skills" section, **zero proof** in experience or projects
- missing **basic dev keywords**: Git, testing, CI/CD, REST API, cloud, even for people who clearly use them daily
- career in infra/support or teaching, but resume saying "full-stack dev" without a real project/product described

> Fix: Only list tech you can defend in an interview and **tie each one** to a role or project.
